This repository represents my implementation for the [Backend Technical Test](https://github.com/luuna-tech/test/blob/master/backend/README.md) applied by Zebrands.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

* [django-notifications-hq](https://pypi.org/project/django-notifications-hq/) Notification system.
